# Command Blocks to Sign
Transform your command blocks into clickable signs!

## üìñ Instructions:
- Place a sign on the side of the command block that you want to convert, with a maximum of 4 command blocks. (They must be facing one to another).
- Take a honeycomb and right click the sign to wax it. (The wax will be removed)
- That's it! Your sign is ready.

The system only reacts if the sign is on a command block, otherwise it will do nothing and the waxing of the sign will act as usual.
